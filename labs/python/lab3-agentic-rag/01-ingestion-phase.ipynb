    "\n",
    "The process of taking a document and splitting into pieces is often referred to as \"chunking\". There are many ways to split a document and it isn't a *one-size-fits-all* activity, so you need to keep in mind how a document needs to be split in order to provide the most valuable chunks for your retrieval system.\n",

    "Important things to remember about these chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will get embeddings for each chunk\n",
    "- Relevant chunks will be found by a similarity search using embeddings\n",
    "- Often times an overlap of 10 - 20% is used if there is not a clean way to split the document\n",
    "- When working with real documents, you may need to address tables and images (images typically have different embedding models or need to be *verbalized*)\n",
    "- Each chunk needs to fit in the context window of the LLM, and keep in mind things can get lost in the middle when the context is too big\n",
    "- You may need to modify your chunking to improve the retrieval quality of your system"
