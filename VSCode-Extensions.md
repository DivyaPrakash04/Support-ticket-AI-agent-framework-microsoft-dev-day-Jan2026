# Essential VS Code Extensions for Agent Development

Visual Studio Code helps streamline the development of AI agents and intelligent applications. The following extensions are highly recommended for developers working with the **[Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework)** in **Python** or **.NET**.

## AI & Agent Tooling

These extensions provide specific workflows for building, testing, and deploying AI agents and connecting to AI services.

| Extension | Why it's useful |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (Preview)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** | Essential for downloading and running local models (SLMs), testing prompts, and deploying models to Azure. |
| **[Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)** | Streamlines the creation of agents for Microsoft 365, including Copilot extensions and Teams bots. |

* **[Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance):** Provides high-performance language support and type checking, which is critical when working with complex agent SDKs.
* **[Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter):** Indispensable for interactive prototyping, testing agent chains, and visualizing data directly within VS Code.

## .NET Development

The modern extension stack for C#-based agent development.
